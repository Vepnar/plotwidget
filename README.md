# Overview
The Plot Widgets library is a lightweight plotting library designed for the Brick TUI (Text User Interface), enabling simple and effective data visualization. Please note that this library is currently under active development and may undergo significant changes without prior notice, as it is the author's first Haskell application. We welcome feedback and suggestions for improvement to help shape the library's future.


# Features
The following features are currently implemented in the library:
* Scatter plots
* Area plots: Display the area below a given point
* Layers: overlay multiple plots on top of each other
* Simple plotting functionality

## Todo
The following features are planned for implementation, in no particular order:
* Line plots
* Heatmaps
* Histograms
* Axes labels/ticks
* Better option parsing
* Braille based pixels (increase resolution)
* Create functioning candle stick charts
